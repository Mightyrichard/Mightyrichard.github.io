<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>This line is here to show how merging works.</p>
<p>A software development quotation is a project cost estimate, usually sent with a software development proposal before you start the job. This document is more important than an invoice because your prospective client must agree to the software quotation and terms before proceeding with the project.</p>
<p>It's a good idea to ask your client for their budget during the briefing, as this will help you create a software development quote that meets expectations and constraints. Keep in mind that some clients will be reluctant to share a budget, wary of it being over your estimate.</p>
